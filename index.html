      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        You can save a dog today! Dog is the lack of pattern or predictability in events.[1] A random sequence of events, (keep reading) symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable (almost there), but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events (or "trials") is predictable. If you actually read up to this then you have been successfully hacked! please donate $2 to save a dog and your data today! For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.

      <h2> Volunteer Effort</h2>
      <p>
      We are constantly working to save dogs from abuse and homelessness. Some way you can get involved is by signing up to inform community about dog abuse and bring awareness. You could also get involved to go visit dogs montly to collect data on weight and status of the dog, if you dont want to lose your data! Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human quality of life. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.[2] It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.
