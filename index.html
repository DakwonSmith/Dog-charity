  Terminology
  The term dog typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.
  An adult female is a bitch.
  An adult male capable of reproduction is a stud.
  An adult female capable of reproduction is a brood bitch, or brood mother.
  Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are pups or puppies.
  A group of pups from the same gestation period is a litter.
  The father of a litter is a sire. It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.
  The mother of a litter is a dam.
  A group of any three or more adults is a pack.
  Taxonomy
  In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf populations, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog "breeds" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other.[20] In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: "familiaris Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]" and "dingo Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]". Wozencraft included hallstromi - the New Guinea singing dog - as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.[1] The inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a "domestic dog" clade has been noted by other mammalogists.[21] This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.[22]

  Origin
  Main article: Origin of the domestic dog
  The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. It is known that the dog was the first domesticated species.[13][15] The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[5] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[6][7][8][9][10] The closest living relative of the dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage.[7][8][23][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister clades,[11][12][13] with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.[12][13] The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago,[24] with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.[25] These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not at the dawn of agriculture.[8][12]

  Where the genetic divergence of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe,[26][8] Central Asia,[26][27] and East Asia.[26][28] This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.[26][29][30]

  Anatomy
  Main article: Dog anatomy
  Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[16] Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.[16] Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

  Size and weight
  Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm (98 in) from the snout to the tail.[31] The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the shoulder.[32]

  Senses
  Further information: Dog anatomy ยง Senses
  The dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.[33][34]

  Coat
  Main article: Coat (dog)

  Dogs display a wide variation on coat type, density, length, color, and composition
  The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only.

  Domestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,[35] which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.[36]

  Regarding coat appearance or health, the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet, see Coat (dog) for more information.

  Tail
  See also: Docking
  There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.[37] In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.[38]

  Differences from wolves

  The Saarloos wolfdog carries more gray wolf DNA than any other dog breed[39]
  Despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to inter-breed, there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase.[40] The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled.[41] Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains.[42]:35 The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs.[43] Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive "stop" between forehead and nose.[44] The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves.[4]:p158 Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them.[45] Most dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year.[46] So-called primitive dogs such as Dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle.[47]

  Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes.[48] The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.[49] The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves.[50] The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[51] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a 6 inches (150 mm) in the Chihuahua to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[52] It is common for most breeds to shed their coat.

  Health
  Main article: Dog health
  There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs (and other mammals) including begonia, Poinsettia and aloe vera.[53]

  Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.

  A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),[54] grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,[55] as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.[56][57] The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.[58] Dogs are susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that for some dogs even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

  Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.[59]

  Lifespan
  Further information: Aging in dogs

  Mixed-breed dogs such as this terrier have been found to run faster and live longer than their pure-bred parents (See heterosis)
  In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).[60]

  The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[61][62][63][64] Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.

  The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.[64]

  The longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.[64] The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[62][63][64][65] The longest-lived dog was "Bluey", who died in 1939 at age 29.5 years of age.[66][67]

  Reproduction
  Main article: Canine reproduction

  Dog nursing newborn puppies
  In domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,[16][68] although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.[16] Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for more than one male to sire the same litter.[16]
